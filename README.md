This 1D parameterized model computes the thermochemical evolution of the lunar core and is tied to extant simulations of mantle evolution and BMO solidification. 

Simply download all files into one directory and then run `modelThermalEvolutionFull.m` to get started. You can specifiy some intial conditions and change the BMO model input used by the code.
